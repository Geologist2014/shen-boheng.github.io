My current research interests primarily focus on the Carboniferous-Permian stratigraphic correlation, provenance analysis, and high-precision palaeogeographic reconstruction of the North China Block (NCB). 

I am proficient in the research methods of stratigraphy, sedimentology, and palaeogeography. Additionally, I am experienced in in the use of geographical information system software platforms such as ArcGIS and GPlates, as well as the method of the detrital zircon U-Pb dating. 

I consistently keep abreast of the latest developments in Earth sciences, particularly in solid Earth sciences. I organize volunteers to track articles from high-level academic journals such as Nature, Science, and Geology, and compile them into relevant digests. This activity has been ongoing for over three years and has gained considerable recognition within both the academic community and the general public in China as well as the international Chinese community.
